/**
 * The one contract between the App Shell page and the main process.
 *
 * The page never touches Electron's IPC directly: the preload exposes exactly
 * the calls below as `window.devhub`, and every one of them is a request the
 * main process answers or an error it throws. There is no second style.
 *
 * This is the Tauri app's command surface with the transport swapped: what was
 * `invoke("dispatch_app_intent", …)` is `devhub.dispatch(intent)`, and what was
 * `listen("app://snapshot-changed", …)` is `devhub.onSnapshot(…)`. The payloads
 * are unchanged, so the App Shell components are the same components.
